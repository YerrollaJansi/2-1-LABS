#               Experiment 11
# AIM : Write a C++ program to create multilevel inheritance.
# Algorithm:  
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream.h).

Step 2 - Create a base class 'A1' with the following class members :'a' as data member  in private and 'show_a1()' as member function in public mode.

Step 3 - Initialise the value of 'a' by using default constructor and implement show_a1 function.

Step 4 - Create a class A2 derived from A1 with the following class members :'b' as data member in private and 'show_a2()' as member function in public mode..

Step 5 - Initialise the value of 'b' by using default constructor and implement show_a2() function.

Step 6 - Create a class A3 derived from A2 with the following class members:'c' as data member in private and 'show_a3()' as member function in public mode.

Step 7 - Declare the A3 class object 'obj' and call the functions show_a1(),show_a2(),show_a3() using dot(.) operator.  

Step 8 - end the program.
