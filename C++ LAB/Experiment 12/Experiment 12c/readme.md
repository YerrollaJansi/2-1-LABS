#            Experiment 12c
# AIM : Write a C++ Program to illustrate concept of Virtual Functions
# Algorithm:  
Step 1: Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2: Declare the base class A with data member x.

Step 3: Declare and define the virtual function display().

Step 4: Create the derived class B from the base class A with data member y.

Step 5: Declare and define the functions display().

Step 6: In the main function, Create the base class pointer variable.

Step 7: Create the derived class object and assign base pointer variable to address of derived class object.  
  
step 8: Call the function display() using the using base class pointer through arrow operator(->).  

Step 9: return 0 and exit the program.
