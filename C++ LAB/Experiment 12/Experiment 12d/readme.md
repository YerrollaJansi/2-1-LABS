#           Experiment 12d
# AIM: Write a c++ Program on Abstract classes 
# Algorithm:  
Step 1: Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2: Declare the base class A with data member x.

Step 3: Create a pure virtual function in A base class with syntax virtual return_type fun()=0; i.e virtual void display()=0;

Step 4: Create the derived class B from the base class A with data member y.

Step 5: Declare and define the functions display() in the derived class.

Step 6: In the main function, Create the base class pointer variable.

Step 7: Create the derived class object and assign base pointer variable to address of derived class object.

step 8: Call the function display() using the using base class pointer through arrow operator(->).

Step 9: return 0 and exit the program.
