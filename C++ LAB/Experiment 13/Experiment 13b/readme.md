#                    Experiment 13b
# AIM : Write a C++ Program for divide by zero using multiple catch 
# Algorithm:  
step-1:include the required header files iostream and exception

step-2:Create a class (Exception1)with all its members in public:a,b variables as data members and calculate() as its member function.  

step-3:Implement calculate function include try block,check If the value is greater than zero then calculate and display, if value is equal to zero throw the value and catch the corresponding exception. Otherwise throw the appropriate exception,close the class.

step-4:Implement function catch() immediately after the try block.create main() method,create object for class and call the function calculate() through object using (.) operator

step-5:End the program.
