# AIM : Write a C++ program on file streams.
# Algorithm:  
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and fstream).

Step 2 - Create a main() method.

Step 3 - Open a file in write mode.

Step 4 - Write input data into the file and also print the input scanned using getline onto the screen .
