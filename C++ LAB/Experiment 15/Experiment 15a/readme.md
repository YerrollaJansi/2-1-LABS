#                    Experiment 15a
#  AIM : Implement a c++ program using binary operator overloading
# Algorithm:
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2 - Create a class (A) with x as private class member. display() as member function.

Step 3 - Define the operator function as void operator +(A) inside the class.

Step 4 - Write respective code for void A :: operator+(A a).

Step 5 - Create a main method().

Step 6 - Create two objects named a1 and a2 using parameterized constructors inside the main method.  

Step 7 - Add two objects.

Step 8 - return 0 to exit the program.
