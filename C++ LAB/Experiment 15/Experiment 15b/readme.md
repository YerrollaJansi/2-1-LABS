#                Experiment 15b
# AIM : Implement a c++ program using unary operator overloading
# Algorithm:  
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2 - Create a class (Unary) with num as private class member. Print() as member function in public mode.

Step 3 - Define the operator function as void operator ++() inside the class.

Step 4 - Write respective code for member function Print().

Step 5 - Create a main method().

Step 6 - Create an object named 't' inside the main method.

Step 7 - Call the operator function '++t'.

Step 8 - Call the member function Print using (.)operator.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit the program .
