#                   Experiment 16b
#  AIM : Write a c++ program to find subtraction of two complex numbers using operator overloading 
# Algorithm:  


Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2 - Create a class (Complex) with real and imag as class members in private members, display() as member function in public mode.

Step 3 - Create a parameterized constructor and then assign the values of real and imag.

Step 4 - Define the operator functions as Complex operator -() inside the class.

Step 5 - Write respective code for member function display().

Step 6 - Create a main method().

Step 7 - Create objects for class Complex inside the main method.

Step 8 - Call the operator functions.

Step 9 - Call the member function display.

Step 10 - return 0 to end the program.
