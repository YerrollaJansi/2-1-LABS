#              Experiment 5
# AIM : Write a C++ program to declare a class. Declare pointer to class. Initialize and display the contents of the class member.
# ALGORITHM:
 Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string).

 Step 3 - Implement the read() and display() member functions.  
 Step 4 - Create a main() method.  
 Step 5 - Create an array of employee object and a pointer of employee class.  
 Step 6 - Assign base address of object array to pointer object and make function calls to read() and display() using class pointer object.
