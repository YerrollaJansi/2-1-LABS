#                 Experiment 8
# AIM : Write a C++ program on Friend Class & Friend Function
# ALGORITHM :
 step 1:include required header file(iostream and string).  
 step 2:using preprocessor define pi value to 3.14.  
 step 3:create three independent classes(A,B and Circle) with their class members respectively.  
 step 4:declare a friend class B in class A to access the private data member of class A and a friend function in class Circle to access private member variable of          class Circle    
 step 5:implement display() and print_area_().  
 step 6:declare objects: c of class Circle ,a of class A ,b of class B and call respective functions.  
 step 7:return 0 to end the program.
