# AIM: Write a C++ program to read the data of N employee and compute Net salary of each employee (DA=52% of Basic) and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary.
# ALGORITHM :

 Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream.h,string).
 Step 2 - Create a class Employee with the following members. emp_no, emp_name,
          Basic, DA, IT, gross_salary, and net_salary as data members 
          read(),display(),calculate_netsalary(),calculate_grosssal() as member functions.
 Step 3 - Implement all the member functions with their respective code.
 Step 4 - Create a main() method.
 Step 5 - Create an array of class object with a specific size and number_of_emp as integer.
 Step 6 - Read number_of_emp(n).
 Step 7 - Call the read(),calculate_netsalary(),calculate_grosssal() and display() methods through the array of class object from 0 to
          number_of_emp.
 Step 8 - returnn 0 to exit form the program execution.
