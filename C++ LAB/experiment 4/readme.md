# Write a C++ program to declare Struct. Initialize and display contents of member Variables.
# ALGORITHM : 
 Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream.h and string).
 Step 2 - Create a structure (student) with the following member variables.
          name, r_no , department, and marks as data members.
 Step 3 - Create a main() method.
 Step 4 - Create a variable of the above structure inside the main() method or create it at the end of struct block.
 Step 5 - Then, read data into member variables of that structure using structure variable
          with dot operator.
 Step 6 - Finally, display data of member variables of that structure using structure variable
          with dot operator.
