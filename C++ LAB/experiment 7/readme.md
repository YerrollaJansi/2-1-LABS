#                           Experiment 7
# AIM : write a c++ program using this pointer
# ALGORITHM :
step 1:Include required header file(iostream and string).\
step 2:create a class(student) with the class members as public members :roll_no,name,marks,grade as data members and display() as its method.<br />
step 3:define a parameterized  constructor student(same data members names) and initialise the variables using this pointer.       
step 4:implement the display() function.<br />
step 5:create main(), in main() create objects(s1,s2) of class student using parameterised constructor.<br />
step 6:call the display() function through both the objects.<br />
step 7:return 0 to end the program.<br />
